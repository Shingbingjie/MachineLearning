The content is a summary of a practice lab on linear regression. The lab focuses on implementing linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise. The lab includes the following sections:

Problem Statement: introducing the scenario of a restaurant franchise considering different cities for opening a new outlet and trying to predict higher profits.

Dataset: loading the dataset containing the population of cities and the corresponding profits.

Refresher on linear regression: providing an overview of linear regression and the cost function.

Compute Cost: implementing a function to calculate the cost function.

Gradient descent: implementing the gradient for parameters in linear regression.

Learning parameters using batch gradient descent: finding the optimal parameters of the linear regression model using batch gradient descent.

Plotting the linear fit: plotting the linear fit based on the learned parameters.

Predicting profits: using the learned parameters to predict profits for specific population values.
